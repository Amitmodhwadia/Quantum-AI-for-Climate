### A] Problem Statement
 - Climate change is one of the biggest challenges in mankind's history. To tackle it, we need to use simulation models that can generate accurate weather forecasts. One type of simulation model is the Monte Carlo Simulation and Uncertainty Analysis, which uses random numbers to simulate various scenarios of climate processes. Quantum computers have shown great potential in generating random numbers. however, the quality and true randomness of these numbers remain uncertain. Ensuring the randomness of these quantum-generated numbers is crucial for the reliability of the simulation models. Therefore, this project aims to evaluate the quality of random numbers generated by quantum computers, with a focus on assessing their randomness and suitability for use in climate simulation models.


 ### B] Project description
 - In this century use of random numbers is everywhere from cryptography to predicting the climate change. That is why generating random numbers and checking the quality of randomness is crucial. the randome numbesrs can use for weather forecasts which is done by Monte Carlo Simulation and Uncertainty Analysis.

#### I.	Monte Carlo Simulations in Climate Modelling *(References -i)*
- Monte Carlo model is a stochastic simulation method. This model is widely used in climate modelling to assess the uncertainty and variability of climate predictions. By generating multiple simulations with different random inputs, we can explore a range of possible future climates and better understand the probability of various outcomes. 
Principle of Monte-Carlo simulations :
-       1. Monte-Carlo simulations are used for processing large amounts of data to calculate minimum, maximum, average, and mean values.
        2. These simulations are numerical methods that handle probabilistic phenomena.
        3. Monte-Carlo methods calculate unknown quantities by statistical sampling.

- Monte-Carlo simulations are the model that used for detecting the huge amount of data. It works for picking some data from a huge database and to calculate the minimum, maximum, the average and the meant. This simulation can work really fast and easily. It is a numerical simulation method which takes probabilistic phenomena as the research object. As a matter of fact, it is a method of calculating unknown characteristic quantity by obtaining statistic value by sampling survey. 

#### Advantages:
- Flexibility: Monte Carlo simulations can be applied to a wide range of climate models and scenarios.

- Uncertainty Quantification: These simulations are essential for quantifying uncertainties in climate predictions.
#### Disadvantages:
- Computational Cost: Monte Carlo simulations require significant computational resources, especially when high-quality random numbers are needed.

- Dependence on RNG Quality: The accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations is directly tied to the quality of the random numbers used.


#### II.	Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) *(References -ii)*

- Existing systems generate random numbers, but we currently lack the means to evaluate the quality of this randomness. Assessing the quality is critical for applications in cryptography, simulations, and statistical sampling, as poor randomness can lead to patterns or biases. that’s why we need Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) because randomness is one of the fundamental of quantum mechanics that will help to generate good quality random numbers 
#### Advantages:
- True Randomness: Quantum processes are inherently random, offering a higher level of unpredictability compared to classical RNGs.
- Time: comparatively QRNGs is faster than classical RNGs.
#### Disadvantages:
- Implementation Complexity: The technology is still in its early stages and can be difficult to implement and scale.
- Quality and Bias Concerns: Despite their theoretical randomness, there are concerns about the quality and potential biases in the random numbers generated by QRNGs, particularly due to noise and hardware imperfections.


#### III.	Evaluation of Random Number Generators *(References -iii)*

- The quality of random numbers generated by both classical and quantum RNGs is typically evaluated using statistical tests such as the NIST Randomness Test Suite, TestU01, and Diehard tests. These tests are designed to detect patterns and biases that may compromise the randomness of the generated numbers.
#### Advantages:
- Comprehensive Testing: These tests provide a thorough evaluation of RNG quality, including aspects such as uniformity and independence.
-  Wide Adoption: These test suites are widely used in both academic and industrial applications, providing a benchmark for RNG quality.
#### Disadvantages:
- Specificity: Some tests may be better suited for certain types of RNGs, and no single test suite can fully guarantee the quality of an RNG.
- Resource Intensity: Running comprehensive tests on large datasets can be computationally expensive.
