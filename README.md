### A] Problem Statement
 - Water is a necessity for all living species. It provides hydration and helps to maintain body temperature, especially when there is extreme heat. The water inside the body will form sweat, cooling the body through evaporation. However, due to climate change and pollution, the quality of water has become questionable. Therefore, it is important that the quality and purity of water are good; otherwise, poor-quality water can create adverse health effects. Our project focus on predicting the Water Potability using Machine learning and use Quantum computing for optimizing the models.
